Q6: The di-gamma function, also known as the digamma function, is a mathematical function that is often used in statistics and probability theory. In this context, the sum of the alphas in the di-gamma function is used as a normalizing constant, which ensures that the output of the function is a valid probability distribution. By dividing the output of the di-gamma function by the sum of the alphas, we can ensure that the probabilities sum to 1, which is a necessary property of any valid probability distribution. This normalization is important because it allows us to make probabilistic predictions based on the output of the di-gamma function.
